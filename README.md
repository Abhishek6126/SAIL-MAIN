# MES APP, SAIL 

A multipurpose application developed by me and my colleague. App features mainly 4 functions (more to be added soon)

The App uses NodeJs as an intermediate to fetch data from the Oracle Database to create a RESTApi to interact directly with the application.




## Features

- **QR Scanner** - To verify the identity of personnel. 
- **Mill Data** - Provides real-time mill production values. 
- **Grievance Report** - To upload details of any Grievance that occurred. 
- **Call/SMS Peers** - Pretty simple and straightforward, and provides a phone directory of personnel you can contact from the app.
